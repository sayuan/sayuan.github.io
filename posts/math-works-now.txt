Docutils has supported math rendering for a while now. That means `Nikola <http://nikola.ralsina.com.ar>`_ should have supported
it for a while too, but never did correctly because ... well, because noone ever tried, maybe?

Well, it does now, because `Damian Avila <http://www.damian.oquanta.info/>`_ has fixed it!

.. TEASER_END

For example, I can now casually mention Euler's formula, which is :math:`e^{ix} = \cos x + i\sin x`
and it just works. How did I do that? Like this::

    I can now casually mention Euler's formula, which is :math:`e^{ix} = \cos x + i\sin x`

And I can show whole equations!

.. math::

   \int \frac{dx}{1+ax}=\frac{1}{a}\ln(1+ax)+C

That was done like this::

    .. math::

       \int \frac{dx}{1+ax}=\frac{1}{a}\ln(1+ax)+C

And all you need to do to make this work is tag your posts as "mathjax" so the right javascript
is loaded. If you don't do that, then your page has no mathematical javascript at all :-)
